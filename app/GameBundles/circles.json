I understand that the diameter is twice the distance of the radius.\n\nI think that circumference is the distance around a circle and the area of a circle is the number of square units inside the circle. The formula for both of these is 2*pi*r. I’m not exactly sure what r is, but I’m guessing that whatever thing they give us in the problem, we can just put in for r. Also, whether or not I am asked for the actual value or just an approximation, I think I should substitute pi with 3.14 in order to get an approximation, just so I end up with a number for whatever value I’m solving for.",
