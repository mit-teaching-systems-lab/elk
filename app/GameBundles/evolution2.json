				"profile": "Natural selection, or in other words, evolution, explains how the characteristics of populations change over time. It refers to the process that occurs when the environment favors certain mutations over others. Mutations are mistakes that happen when DNA is passed down from parents to their offspring, and sometimes these mutations are good for the organism and sometimes they are bad. If the mutation is bad for the organism in context of how it survives, the organism will die. If it is good, the organism will live and will pass on that good trait onto offspring. If this happens, then natural selection has selected that good mutation and the population will evolve. Thus, organisms further along in evolution have had more time to improve and progress.\n\nNatural selection is sometimes called “survival of the fittest” because only the organisms that are the best fit for the environment will survive and pass on genes. For example, the fastest cheetahs can get the most food, so they will survive and pass on their genes so their offspring will also be fast. ",

				"profile": "Evolution explains how the characteristics of populations change over time. There are several things that lead to evolution, including migration and genetic drift, and natural selection is just one of them. Evolution occurs when there is a change in external factors that requires a change in the organisms. For example, rocks in the Southeast were covered with black volcanic rock, and so over time, the pocket mice that lived there adapted to the new environment and evolved to have darker fur to accommodate the changing environment through mutations. External factors are changing all the time and an organism best suited for one environment is not necessarily best suited for other environments.\n\nIn this way, organisms and species are always advancing and improving on previous versions in life. The more evolved an animal is, the more progress it has had and the more time it had to adapt to the perfect animal to fit its environment.",
