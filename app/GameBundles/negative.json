				"profile": "I think that positive numbers are numbers greater than or equal to zero, and negative numbers are numbers less than zero. Negative numbers have a - sign in front of them and are the same distance from zero as their positive counterparts. I also think that negative numbers cannot be fractions or decimals, only whole numbers with a - sign can be negative.\n\nI think that for operations with positive and negative numbers, the sign of the first number is the one for the answer. So -4+5=-1. Addition with negative numbers goes straight to subtraction. So 4+-5=4-5=-1-->1 because the first number, 4, was positive.\n\nMultiplication works by multiply all of the numbers as if they were positive, and then putting the sign of the first number in front. So -5*2=-10 and -5*-2=-10. Division works the same way as multiplication.",
